# Data pre-processing and evaluation in MATLAB
The aim of this project was to compare different data preprocessing methods. There are three commonly
used data preprocessing methods, rescaling, standardization and normalization. For more details,
please read here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling. I have used the covtype data set, available here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype. A training/testing split has to be created. The project was divided intot he following tasks:

-Build an SVM classifier for classifying label “2”(positive) vs the rest (negative). 

-Compare the accuracy, F1-score, AUC on the testing data for using each preprocessed
data and the raw data.
